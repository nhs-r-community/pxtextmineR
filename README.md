An R wrapper for Python's [`pxtextmining`](https://pypi.org/project/pxtextmining/) 
library- a pipeline to classify text-based patient experience data.

**Function documentation**: https://nhs-r-community.github.io/pxtextmineR/.

Package `pxtextmineR` does not wrap _everything_ from `pxtextmining`, but 
selected functions that will offer R users new opportunities for modelling. For 
example, the whole [`Scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) 
(Pedregosa et al., 2011) text classification pipeline is wrapped, as 
well as helper functions for e.g. sentiment analysis with Python's 
[`textBlob`](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/) and
[`vaderSentiment`](https://pypi.org/project/vaderSentiment/).

How does the wrapper work? It uses R package [`reticulate`](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/),
which provides tools for interoperability between Python and R.

## Installation and setup
There are a few things that need to be done to install and set up `pxtextmineR`.

1. Run `devtools::install_github("nhs-r-community/pxtextmineR")` in the R 
   console.
1. Create a Python _virtual environment_. If not familiar with virtual 
   environments please take a look at [this](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) 
   and [this](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/). R package `reticulate` has 
   functions to create a Python virtual environment via the R console. Refer to 
   `reticulate::conda_create` and `reticulate::virtualenv_create`. For example, 
   if using [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/index.html#), run 
  
   `reticulate::conda_create("r-reticulate")`
  
   where `r-reticulate` is the name of `reticulate`'s default virtual environment.
   Using this default virtual environment for `pxtextmineR` is strongly 
   recommended because it makes the setup so much easier. According to the 
   `reticulate` authors' [own words](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/package.html)
   "_[i]tâ€™s much more straightforward for users if there is a common environment 
   used by R packages [...]_"
1. Tell `reticulate` to use the `r-reticulate` virtual environment:
  
   `reticulate::use_condaenv("r-reticulate", required = TRUE)`
1. Install Python package [`pxtextmining`](https://pypi.org/project/pxtextmining/) 
   in `r-reticulate`:
  
   `reticulate::py_install(envname = "r-reticulate", packages = "pxtextmining", pip = TRUE)`
1. We also need to install a couple of 
   [`spaCy`](https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models) models in `r-reticulate`. 
   These are obtained from URL links and thus need to be installed separately. 
   In the R console run:
   
   ```
   system("pip install https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models/releases/download/en_core_web_sm-2.3.1/en_core_web_sm-2.3.1.tar.gz")
   
   system("pip install https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models/releases/download/en_core_web_lg-2.3.1/en_core_web_lg-2.3.1.tar.gz")
   ```

All steps in one go:

```
devtools::install_github("nhs-r-community/pxtextmineR")
# If not using Conda, comment out the next two lines and uncomment the two lines 
# following them.
reticulate::conda_create("r-reticulate")
reticulate::use_condaenv("r-reticulate", required = TRUE)
# reticulate::virtualenv_create("r-reticulate")
# reticulate::use_virtualenv("r-reticulate", required = TRUE)
reticulate::py_install(envname = "r-reticulate", packages = "pxtextmining", pip = TRUE)
system("pip install https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models/releases/download/en_core_web_sm-2.3.1/en_core_web_sm-2.3.1.tar.gz")
system("pip install https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models/releases/download/en_core_web_lg-2.3.1/en_core_web_lg-2.3.1.tar.gz")

```

### A NOTE OF CAUTION!
The installation instructions above did not work in all machines on which the 
installation process was tested. There were two problems:

1. In some machines `reticulate` would simply 
   refuse to install in virtual environment `r-reticulate` the version of 
`Scikit-learn` that `pxtextmining` uses (v 0.23.2).
1. When trying to use a virtual environment other than `r-reticulate` (i.e.    `reticulate::use_condaenv("<some_other_virtual_environment>", required = TRUE)`),
   the behaviour of `reticulate` was confusing. On the one hand, it would run 
   `pxtextmineR` functions using the user-specified virtual environment. However, 
   on the other hand, when running commands to build e.g. function documentation 
   with R package `pkgdown`, `reticulate` would automatically set `r-reticulate` as 
   the default environment, causing the code to break.

We have opted for a more "invasive" [approach](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/pxtextmineR/commit/44fdce8ddf0a53f57d57936f78b4a477484d2ba0) to fix this problem so that users can use any virtual environment 
with no issues. This requires the following steps:

1. Create a Python virtual environment using e.g. Anaconda, Miniconda or a 
   Virtual Python Environment.
1. In it, install `pxtextmining` and the `spaCy` models:
   ```
   pip install pxtextmining
   system("pip install https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models/releases/download/en_core_web_sm-2.3.1/en_core_web_sm-2.3.1.tar.gz")
   system("pip install https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models/releases/download/en_core_web_lg-2.3.1/en_core_web_lg-2.3.1.tar.gz")

   ```
1. Use a text editor to open your `.Renviron` file, normally located in 
   `~/.Renviron`, and add the following lines:

    ```
    PXTEXTMINER_PYTHON_VENV_MANAGER=name_or_path_to_venv_manager
    PXTEXTMINER_PYTHON_VENV=name_of_venv
    ```
 
    where "name_of_venv" should be replaced by the name of the virtual 
    and "name_or_path_to_venv_manager" should be replaced by the name or path 
    to the virtual environment manager. If using Conda or Miniconda, replace 
    "name_or_path_to_venv_manager" with "conda" or "miniconda" (unquoted) 
    respectively. If  using a Virtual Python Environment, replace 
    "name_or_path_to_venv_manager" with the path to the virtual environment's 
    `python.exe` e.g. `/home/user/venvs/myvenv/bin/python`.
1. Good idea to restart R Studio.
1. Run `devtools::install_github("nhs-r-community/pxtextmineR")` in the R 
   console.
1. Again, good idea to restart R Studio. If there are error messages that the 
   user-specified Python environment cannot be set, close and re-open R Studio.
