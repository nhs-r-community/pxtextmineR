\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame with the text feature.}

\item{y}{A vector with the response variable.}

\item{tknz}{Tokenizer to use ("spacy" or "wordnet").}

\item{ordinal}{Whether to fit an ordinal classification model. The ordinal
model is the implementation of \href{https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~eibe/pubs/ordinal_tech_report.pdf}{Frank and Hall (2001)}
that can use any standard classification model that calculates
probabilities.}

\item{metric}{A string. Scorer to use during pipeline tuning
("accuracy_score", "balanced_accuracy_score", "matthews_corrcoef",
"class_balance_accuracy_score").}

\item{cv}{Number of cross-validation folds.}

\item{n_iter}{Number of parameter settings that are sampled (see
\href{https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV.html}{\code{sklearn.model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV}}).}

\item{n_jobs}{Number of jobs to run in parallel (see \code{sklearn.model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV}).
\strong{NOTE:} If your machine does not have the number of cores specified in
\code{n_jobs}, then an error will be returned.}

\item{verbose}{Controls the verbosity (see \code{sklearn.model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV}).}

\item{learners}{A vector of \code{Scikit-learn} names of the learners to tune. Must
be one or more of "SGDClassifier", "RidgeClassifier", "Perceptron",
"PassiveAggressiveClassifier", "BernoulliNB", "ComplementNB",
"MultinomialNB", "KNeighborsClassifier", "NearestCentroid",
"RandomForestClassifier". When a single model is used, it can be passed as
a string.}

\item{theme}{For internal use by Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation
Trust or other trusts that use theme labels ("Access",
"Environment/ facilities" etc.). The column name of the theme variable.
Defaults to \code{NULL}. If supplied, the theme variable will be used as a
predictor (along with the text predictor) in the model that is fitted
with criticality as the response variable. The rationale is two-fold.
First, to help the model improve predictions on criticality when the
theme labels are readily available. Second, to force the criticality for
"Couldn't be improved" to always be "3" in the training and test data, as
well as in the predictions. This is the only criticality value that
"Couldn't be improved" can take, so by forcing it to always be "3", we
are improving model performance, but are also correcting possible
erroneous assignments of values other than "3" that are attributed to
human error.}

\item{python_setup}{A \code{logical} whether to set up the \code{Python} version,
virtual environment etc. that can be controlled with arguments
\code{sys_setenv}, \code{which_python}, \code{which_venv} and \code{venv_name}. These
arguments will be ignored when \code{python_setup} is \code{FALSE}. The purpose of
\code{python_setup} is that users may wish to control the \code{Python} parameters
outside the actual function, for the session in general.}

\item{sys_setenv}{A string in the form "path_to_python/python.exe",
indicating which Python to use (e.g. from a virtual environment).}

\item{which_python}{Same as \code{sys_setenv}.}

\item{which_venv}{A string that can be "conda", "miniconda" or "python".}

\item{venv_name}{String. The name of the virtual environment.}

\item{text_col_name}{A string with the column name of the text variable.}
}
\value{
A fitted \code{Scikit-learn} pipeline containing a number of objects that
can be accessed with the \code{$} sign (see examples). For a partial list see
"Atributes" in \href{https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV.html}{\code{sklearn.model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV}}.
Do not be surprised if more objects are in the pipeline than those in the
aforementioned "Attributes" list. Python objects can contain a wide array
of objects, from numeric results (e.g. the pipeline's accuracy),
to \emph{methods} (i.e. functions in the R lingo) and \emph{classes}. In Python,
these are normally accessed with \verb{object.<whatever>}, but in R the
command is \verb{object$<whatever>}. For instance, one can access method
\code{predict()} to make predictions on unseen data. See examples.

\description{
Prepare and fit a text classification pipeline with
\href{https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html}{\code{Scikit-learn}}.
}
\details{
The pipeline's parameter grid switches between two approaches to text
classification: Bag-of-Words and Embeddings. For the former, both TF-IDF and
raw counts are tried out.

The pipeline does the following:

\itemize{
\item{Feature engineering:
\itemize{
\item{Converts text into TF-IDFs or \href{https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/}{\code{GloVe}}
word vectors with \href{https://spacy.io/}{\code{spaCy}}.}
\item{Creates a new feature that is the length of the text in
each record.}
\item{Performs sentiment analysis on the text feature and creates
new features that are all scores/indicators produced by
\href{https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/}{\code{TextBlob}}
and \href{https://pypi.org/project/vaderSentiment/}{\code{vaderSentiment}}.}
\item{Applies \href{https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.KBinsDiscretizer.html}{\code{sklearn.preprocessing.KBinsDiscretizer}}
to the text length and sentiment indicator features, and
\href{https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html}{\code{sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler}}
to the embeddings (word vectors).}
}
}
\item{Up-sampling of rare classes: uses \href{https://imbalanced-learn.org/stable/references/generated/imblearn.over_sampling.RandomOverSampler.html#imblearn.over_sampling.RandomOverSampler}{\code{imblearn.over_sampling.RandomOverSampler}}
to up-sample rare classes. Currently the threshold to consider a
class as rare and the up-balancing values are fixed and cannot be
user-defined.}
\item{Tokenization and lemmatization of the text feature: uses \code{spaCy}
(default) or \href{https://www.nltk.org/}{\code{NLTK}}. It also strips
punctuation, excess spaces, and metacharacters "r" and "n" from the
text. It converts emojis into \code{"__text__"} (where "text" is the emoji
name), and NA/NULL values into \code{"__notext__"} (the pipeline does get
rid of records with no text, but this conversion at least deals with
any escaping ones).}
\item{Feature selection: Uses \href{https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.SelectPercentile.html}{\code{sklearn.feature_selection.SelectPercentile}}
with \href{https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.chi2.html#sklearn.feature_selection.chi2}{\code{sklearn.feature_selection.chi2}}
for TF-IDFs or \href{https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.f_classif.html#sklearn-feature-selection-f-classif}{\code{sklearn.feature_selection.f_classif}}
for embeddings.}
\item{Fitting and benchmarking of user-supplied \code{Scikit-learn}
\href{https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html}{estimators}.}
}

The numeric values in the grid are currently lists/tuples (Python objects) of
values that are defined either empirically or are based on the published
literature (e.g. for Random Forest, see \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09596}{\verb{Probst et al. 2019}}).
Values may be replaced by appropriate distributions in a future release.
}
\note{
The pipeline uses the tokenizers of \code{Python} library \code{pxtextmining}.
Any warnings from \code{Scikit-learn} like \verb{UserWarning: The parameter 'token_pattern' will not be used since 'tokenizer' is not None'} can
therefore be safely ignored.\cr\cr
Also, any warnings about over-sampling can also be safely ignored. These
warnings are simply a result of an internal check in the over-sampler of
\href{https://imbalanced-learn.org/stable/install.html}{\code{imblearn}}.
